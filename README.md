# Mini Project Description:
To maintain good eye health, it's essential to give your eyes regular breaks, especially when spending extended periods staring at screens. That's why I've implemented a simple but effective solution based on the 30/30/30 rule: for every 30 minutes of screen time, take a 30-second break by focusing on something at least 30 meters away. (modified from 20/20/20 rule)

I wanted to start implememnting this rule whilst I'm working but kept finding myself forgetting. So I created this website to serve as a handy eye health reminder. It prominently displays a color change every 30 minutes, prompting you to take that much-needed break for your eyes..
