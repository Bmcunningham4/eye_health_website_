# Mini Project Description:
To maintain good eye health, it's essential to give your eyes regular breaks, especially when spending extended periods staring at screens. That's why I've implemented a simple but effective solution based on the 30/30/30 rule: for every 30 minutes of screen time, take a 30-second break by focusing on something at least 30 meters away. (modified from 20/20/20 rule)

I wanted to start implememnting this rule whilst I'm working but kept finding myself forgetting. So I created this website using prompt engineering, to serve as a handy eye health reminder. It prominently displays a color change every 30 minutes, prompting you to take that much-needed break for your eyes. I designed it to sit discreetly in a tab, typically at the bottom right of the screen, ensuring that whenever the color shifts, it's a gentle nudge to pause and follow the eye health practice. Moreover, I've hosted this website using GitHub Pages, making it accessible not only on my device but also for anyone concerned about their eye health.
